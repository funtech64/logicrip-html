      <h2>Appeal to History</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Claims something is right or inevitable because it has always happened that way.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> War has always existed, so it’s natural.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Just because something happened before doesn’t mean it should continue.</p>
