      <h2>Genetic Fallacy</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Judges a claim based on its origin rather than its merits.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> That idea came from a political group I dislike, so it must be wrong.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Evaluate the claim, not where it came from.</p>
