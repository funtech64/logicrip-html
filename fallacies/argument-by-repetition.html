      <h2>Argument by Repetition</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Repeats a claim often enough to persuade, rather than proving it.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> This product works. This product works. This product works!</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Repetition isnâ€™t proof. Look for logic and evidence.</p>
