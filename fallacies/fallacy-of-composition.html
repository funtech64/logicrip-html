      <h2>Fallacy of Composition</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assumes that whatâ€™s true for a part is true for the whole.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Each part of the airplane is light, so the plane must be light.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Evaluate wholes independently from their parts.</p>
