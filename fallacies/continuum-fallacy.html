title: Continuum Fallacy

      <h2>Continuum Fallacy</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Dismisses claims because a line or distinction can't be clearly defined.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can’t define when a heap becomes a heap, so there’s no such thing as a heap.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Vagueness doesn’t make distinctions meaningless.</p>
