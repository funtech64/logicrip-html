      <h2>Appeal to Authority</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> This fallacy occurs when someone claims a statement is true because an authority says it is, without evidence.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> It must be correct because a Nobel laureate said so.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Even experts can be wrong. Always look for supporting evidence.</p>
