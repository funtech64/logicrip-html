      <h2>Argument from Incredulity</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Claims something must be false because it's hard to understand or believe.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> I can't imagine how the universe started — so it must have been created.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Difficulty understanding doesn’t equal falsehood.</p>
