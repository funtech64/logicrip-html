      <h2>False Cause</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assumes a real or perceived relationship between things means one caused the other.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> More people drowned when ice cream sales went up — ice cream causes drowning.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider third variables or coincidence. Correlation isn’t causation.</p>
