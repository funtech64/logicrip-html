      <h2>Appeal to Ignorance</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Asserts something is true because it hasn’t been proven false, or vice versa.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> No one has proven aliens don’t exist, so they must be real.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Lack of evidence isn’t proof of anything. Demand support.</p>
