      <h2>Composition</h2>
      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Assumes what's true of parts is true of the whole.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Each part of the machine is light, so the whole machine is light.</p>
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check whether the whole behaves differently than its parts.</p>
