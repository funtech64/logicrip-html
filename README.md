# LogicalFallacies.fun

This repository contains the Jekyll source for [LogicalFallacies.fun](http://logicalfallacies.fun), an open educational site about logical fallacies.

## About

- 📚 **Purpose:** Teach logical thinking with easy, fast, no-login content.
- 🚀 **My AI Work:** I also build LLMs and GPT tools that use clean logic data — see my other repos or visit [logicalfallacies.fun](http://logicalfallacies.fun) for more.
- ✍️ **Author:** [Your Name] — passionate about clear thinking and fair debate.

## Development

The site now uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a custom layout and no theme. Run `jekyll build` or `jekyll serve` to generate the site locally.
